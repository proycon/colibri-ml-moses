train:
  - build moses phrasetable
  - load moses phrasetable + original corpus
  - extract context features (extends phrasetable)
  - write new extended phrasetable 

  - build classifiers from extended phrasetable
  - train classifiers

test:
  - load test data, rewrite intermediate test data with indices instead of words
  - load extended phrasetable

  - find patterns in test that occur in ext.phrasetable
	- if a classifier exists:
		  - extract context features 
			- classify	 
			- process classifier results in score vector
        - write temporary phrasetable with indices replacing the phrase

   - write adapted moses.ini
   - invoke moses to decode
